ldesc: "Window Maker is the GNU window manager for the X Window System.
It was designed to emulate the look and feel of part of the NEXTSTEP(tm)
GUI. It's supposed to be relatively fast and small, feature rich, easy
to configure and easy to use, with a simple and elegant appearance
borrowed from NEXTSTEP(tm)."
